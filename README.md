======
Board design and firmware for all modules used with the AquaPic Aquarium Controller. Each board should have corresponding firmware that works with that board version. All modules communicate with and are controlled by the [master controller/head unit](https://github.com/AquaPic/AquaPicController).

### Status
**IMPORTANT**: All modules are a work in progress. Most, if not all, are probably unstable and currently untested.
