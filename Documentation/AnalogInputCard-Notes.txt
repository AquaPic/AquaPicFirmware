Switched to PIC32MM0064GPM028 because there will be quite a bit of 16 and 32 bit math including division. The PIC16F is terrible at this especially with the free compiler.

Voltage divider protection:
Vout = (Vin * 10) / (24.99 - RVx)
With RVx at 0R the minimum voltage to reach full scale is 3.07V

Using bi-directional level shifts for the TX/RX lines, because it seems to be the cheapest option.
